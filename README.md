Openscad library for AREI symbols

This is an open source library for the openscad textual drawing tool.
The library contains the most relevant set of symbols for AREI, and
can be used to document electrical wiring in a house. The library
also contains a set of symbols which can be used to draw the floorplan
of a house. An easy example for a dummy house is also provided, as
well as an example makefile, and some example latex scripts that
can be used to convert the openscad drawings into pdf.

Required tools for the library:
- openscad version 2015.03-1 or newer (Text is a problem in earlier versions)

Required tools for the example:
- make, any recent version
- inkscape, any recent version
- pdflatex, any recent version
- your favorite pdf reader
